List of Components:
- Arduino Uno
- 10k Resistors x4
- 4.7k Resistors x2
- Photoresistors (LDR) x2
- Servo
- DC-DC Buck Converter (link below if you want to see which one I used)
- Solar Panel 10W
- DC male plug
- 12V Lead Acid Battery


NOTE: Circuit charges battery by connecting DC-DC converter previosly configured to output 13.8V, however no charging circuit is implemented since it is meant to be as simple as possible.
